\textbf{Train Planner} {(Team leader \& primary developer) }   
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Started as a planning model for Service Planners to test and evaluate new train plans, then grew up to a full-functional web-based platform providing easy-to-use planning and visualization functionalities; Received widely usage from various departments (including but not limit to: Engineering, Passenger-relation, Network Modeling and Service Planning)
    \item  Combined optimization, data-mining, simulation and web-based visualization techniques in one system
    \item  Greatly enhanced decision-makings and communications on rail network operations; Received multiple awards in acknowledgment; Multiple presentations were given  on cross-departmental meetings as well as academic conference (INFORMS 2017) to introduce this work

        \item {
\textbf{Line-of-road (LOR) Emulator} {(Sole developer)} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  A visualization tool to help railroad managers understand network status and identify bottlenecks -- Train movements are animated on a map view; Slow-moving or long-dwelled trains are detected and highlighted by colorful bubbles; Dashboard charts show dynamic statistics of the network
    \item  Designed and implemented data pre-loading and caching mechanisms to handle datasets with titanic records
    \item  Used to show the executive team and board members of CSX how congestion happened on the northern tier corridor in 2014, received high appreciation and won Spotlight award
\end{itemize}

        \item {
\textbf{Hump Yard Simulation System (HYSS)} {(Project manager \& developer)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  A web-based system to simulate the processes of hump yards (receiving, classifying and departing), and to predict yard status under given inputs
    \item  Managed project progress; Developed a tool to speed up data preparation (from 6 weeks to 3 days) and designed statistical tests to validate simulation models
    \item  HYSS was used to perform various what-if analysis and provided strategic and tactical decision support (e.g., planning track utilization and right-sizing of yard resources)
