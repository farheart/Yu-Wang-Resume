        \textbf{Train Planner} 
        % {\small{[Python (Django, Scikit-Learn), JavaScript]}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Combined optimization, data-mining, and simulation to create a web-based decision support tool to schedule / simulate / visualize the meet-and-pass (time \& location) of line-of-road trains 
            \item  Used widely by various departments of CSX -- Service Planning: test and evaluate new plans; Engineering: find proper time windows for maintenance; Network operation: perform capacity and impact analysis, etc.
        \end{itemize}

    \item {
        \textbf{Line-of-road Emulator} 
        %{\small{[Java (Tomcat), JavaScript (jQuery, D3) / AnyLogic \texttrademark]}}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item  Created a tool to help managers identify network bottlenecks and evaluate impacts by dynamic visualization. 
               Data pre-loading and caching modules are developed to improve running efficiency and user experiences
        \item  Provided two levels of view to monitor train movements on GIS map  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Macro view overlooks the whole network, finds and marks out problematic trains (e.g., slow or long-dwelled). 
                   It was used to illustrate to executive team and board members how congestion happened on the northern tier corridor in 2014 winter, 
                   and received high appreciation and won CSX Spotlight award
            \item  Micro view zooms to local and shows trains as moving strips, which enables users observing more details en route. 
                   It was used to analyze the blockage to road traffic in Elsdon, IL to dispute the accusation from TRB
            \end{itemize}

        % {\small{[Microsoft C\#, Access, SQL Server, R]}}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item  Project manager. Developed data feeding module. Designed and performed statistical tests to validate output of HYSS,
              which consists of 6 hump yard models simulating their processes on receiving, classifying and departing
              % (receiving, classifying and departing), and to predict yard status under given inputs
              % a tool to speed up data preparation (from 6 weeks to 3 days) and 
        \item  Assisted network modeling team using HYSS to perform various what-if analysis and to make strategic and tactical decisions (e.g., planning track utilization and right-sizing of yard resources)
