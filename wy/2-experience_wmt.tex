        \textbf{Train Planner} 
        {\small{[Python (Django, Scikit-Learn), JavaScript]}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Combined optimization, data-mining, and simulation to create a decision support tool to schedule / simulate / visualize the meet-and-pass (time \& location) of trains 
            \item Used widely by various departments of CSX -- Service Planning: test and evaluate new plans; Engineering: find proper time windows for maintenance; Network operation: performance / capacity / impact analysis, etc.
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Line-of-road (LOR) Emulator} 
        {\small{[AnyLogic, Java, Tomcat, JavaScript (jQuery, D3)]}}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item  Created a visualization tool to help railroad managers understand network status and identify bottlenecks. The tool can animate train movements on a map view, detect and highlight slow-moving or long-dwelled trains with colorful bubbles, and show dynamic statistics of the network in dashboards. To improve usability and efficiency, data pre-loading and caching mechanisms are implemented to handle huge datasets
        \item  Used to show the executive team and board members of CSX how congestion happened on the northern tier corridor in 2014, received high appreciation and wined Spotlight award
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Hump Yard Simulation System (HYSS)} {\small{[Microsoft C\#, Access, SQL Server, R]}}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item  Managed project progress, developed a tool to speed up data preparation (from 6 weeks to 3 days) and designed statistical tests to validate output of HYSS (HYSS is a web-based system to simulate the processes of hump yards (receiving, classifying and departing), and to predict yard status under given inputs)
        \item  Assisted network modeling team using HYSS to perform various what-if analysis and to make strategic and tactical decisions (e.g., planning track utilization and right-sizing of yard resources)
